	# define that any IPv4 or IPv6 address will be allowed to connect. The default firewall settings

	# are chasing a bug, set the argument to 'debug=1'. It isn't recommended to leave that log level
	# intact though. The default state of this build is to output the BuiltinMiner info, so if you
	# don't want to see it, you can change the argument to 'debug=0'. We think the BuiltinMiner info
	# is fun though, but on a Pi, to reduce SD card writes, it might be most efficient to go with
	# the least amount of debug info, so change it to 'debug=0'.

	# By default, wallet functions in LynxCI are disabled. This is for security reasons. If you

	# reverse action to disable wallet functions on this node. You can always check to see if
	# wallet functions are enabled with '$ /root/lynx/src/lynx-cli help', looking for the
