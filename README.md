# [Lynx](https://getlynx.io) Block Crawler

The Lynx Block Crawler is a PHP application that provides real-time blockchain inspection tools to the user. In addition to being able to research discreet transactions, users can inspect blocks and addresses (coming soon). The interface also provides FAQ and News feeds from the Lynx website plus widgets from various partner sites. The Block Crawler is installed by default with LynxCI and LynxCI ISO for Raspberry Pi.

Helpful videos that answer many questions are available on our [Lynx FAQ](https://getlynx.io/faq/).

## What is Lynx?

Lynx is a secure cryptocurrency with fast transaction speeds and low-transaction fees. It’s also eco-friendly & easy-to-use. In 2017, our team upgraded, fixed and rebranded Kittehcoin as Lynx. How? We successfully forked Litecoin and ported the Kittehcoin blockchain history to it. This gives Lynx all the benefits of Litecoin with the full transaction history of Kittehcoin. The upgrades fixed the flaws in the original coin and revived its community of users. It’s cryptocurrency from the past; redesigned for the future.

## How is Lynx an "eco-friendly cryptocurrency"?

According to a recent article in [Wired magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-global-warming/);, “Bitcoin emits the equivalent of 17.7 million tons of carbon dioxide every year.” That’s a big problem! At Lynx, we believe that for cryptocurrency to be considered a secure, financial solution for today’s global marketplace, it must be created with global sustainability in mind. The energy costs of high-volume mining rigs are too demanding and they create an over-reliance on fossil fuels. Lynx code discourages high-volume mining rigs because our code purposefully lacks incentives to mine it for profit. Here are some of the business rules that help us achieve this goal:

1. The mining reward takes one week to “mature.”

2. The individual mining reward is only 1 Lynx (+ fees).

3. The cost of a transaction is 0.0001 Lynx/kb.

4. Proof of Work was modified to better secure against a 51% attack.

Lynx is a cryptocurrency from the past re-designed for the future. We designed Lynx to have minimal environmental impact because we’re committed to creating global solutions and maintaining a small carbon footprint. Lynx business rules encourage the use of low-cost computing (like a Raspberry Pi which only consumes less than 3 watts of electricity) to mine the coin. As a result, the electrical cost to maintain the Lynx network is a fraction of a fraction which results in a low environmental impact. The emphasis on low-cost computing also creates a decentralized, broad miner base which also strengthens the stability and security of the currency.
